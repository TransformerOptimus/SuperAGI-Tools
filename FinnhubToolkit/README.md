I am not affiliated with either SuperAGI or any financial institutions whose API this plugin uses.

I believe the LICENSE voids any responsibility, but I will say this anyway:

This plugin may be used as is, and is aimed at research and development. It should not be used for any live trading. It may contain bugs and it may report wrong data. Any use on real markets is strongly discouraged without verifying the information it gives by a human actor. Under no circumstances should this tool be used for autonomous trading. Doing so may lead to financial loss.

The information this plugin provides should not be considered financial advice, and should not be facilitated to provide financial advice.

TL;DR: Use at your own risk.
